*A tool for modeling the architecture of workflows, dependencies, and cognitive load in software and organizational systems.*

# Intent

Project Symarow is to be used as a visual aid for potential current and future constraints in workflow. The tools’ purpose is to be used as statistical input for dialogue when processes, teams or architecture are reviewed or planned to change in an organization.

Most importantly the input is expected to be biased and therefore this tool will not measure quantitative results but potential. It is not be used as a metric or for prediction due to context, bias, human psyche and cognitive capacity of individuals working in an organisation.
